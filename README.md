# SQLtoXMLconvert

This is a team project that was designed to accept specific SQL statements, 
parse them for accuracy and to glean correlating information,
retrieve the data from an Oracle DB, and convert the request into XML format.

My main contribution was the parser (SQLparser.java). I did not include my
peers work due to a lack of permission.
